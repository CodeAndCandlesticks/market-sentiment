# Market Sentiment Checker

This Python script fetches the latest stock market update from [Schwab's daily open report](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/stock-market-update-open), analyzes it using a language model (OpenAI or Anthropic), and logs whether the current market sentiment is **Bullish**, **Bearish**, or **Mixed**.

Sentiment results are stored in a local `.csv` file with the date, sentiment, model used, model version, article hash, and full raw response — perfect for integrating with trading scripts or position sizing strategies.

## Features

- Pulls the latest article from Schwab's Market Open page
- Supports OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude models
- Classifies sentiment as Bullish, Bearish, or Mixed
- Logs results in a `.csv` format with overwrite detection
- Logs full raw LLM response and article content hash for transparency
- Extracts and logs the published date from the article HTML
- Sends push notifications using the Pushover API
- Includes a developer log file with INFO and DEBUG levels
- Controlled via environment variables using `.env`

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file

```env
USE_MODEL=anthropic                   # or "openai"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=your-pushover-user-key
PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN=your-pushover-api-token
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                        # or DEBUG, WARNING
```

## Output Example
